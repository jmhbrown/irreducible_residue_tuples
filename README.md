# irreducible_residue_tuples
Calculates the frequency of residue tuples in irreducible polynomials over various finite fields

# Installing and Running
This code was written for `python3` and uses the `sympy` package.

Run the code like so -
```
python __init.py
```

# TODO

* Stop hard coding degree and coefficients
* Calculate tuple frequencies
