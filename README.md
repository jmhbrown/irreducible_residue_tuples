# Irreducible Residue Tuples
Calculates the frequency of residue tuples in irreducible polynomials over various finite fields

# Installing and Running
This code was written for `python3` and uses the `sympy` package.

Run the code like so -
```
python __init.py
```

# TODO

* Read parameters from an input file
* Pretty (read: readable) output, output files
* Double check sequence counting logic - it seems to get buggy at higher degrees.
